# Cub3D

Cub3D is a game engine project developed as part of the 42 school curriculum, inspired by the classic game Wolfenstein 3D. It involves building a raycasting-based first-person perspective game that allows players to navigate through a maze-like environment, with textured walls and interactive elements. The project emphasizes graphics programming, file parsing, and game mechanics.

The main objective of Cub3D is to create a visually immersive 3D game using raycasting techniques. The project introduces students to the fundamentals of game development, including rendering, input handling, map parsing, and game logic implementation.

## Key Features:

- Raycasting rendering: Cub3D uses raycasting techniques to render a 3D view of the game world, simulating a first-person perspective.
- Textured walls: The project incorporates textured walls to create a visually appealing environment, enhancing the immersive experience.
- Map parsing: Cub3D parses map files that define the layout of the game world, including walls, sprites, and other interactive elements.
- Game mechanics: The project implements game mechanics such as player movement, collision detection, interaction with objects, and enemy AI.
- User interface: Cub3D includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays game information, such as the player's health and score.

*By working on Cub3D, you will gain practical experience in graphics programming, game development concepts, and problem-solving skills. It offers an opportunity to apply algorithms, optimize performance, and create an interactive game environment.*

**Note:** This project was developed as part of the 42 school curriculum and should be considered a learning exercise rather than a fully-featured commercial game engine.*
